          Have you ever streamed a video online only to find it pixelated and
          blurry? It's a common frustrationâ€”trying to enjoy content, but the low
          resolution strips away the details. Many video players struggle to
          maintain high-quality playback, especially when working with
          low-resolution videos, leaving viewers wanting more clarity.
          <br />
          <br />
          This challenge inspired our university final year project: developing
          a model for superresolution. Superresolution is a transformative
          process that enhances the resolution of images or videos, creating
          higher-quality content from lower-resolution sources. This case study
          explores our approach to addressing this problem and the innovative
          solution we developed.
